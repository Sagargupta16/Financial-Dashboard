### Coding Standards

#### JavaScript/React

- Use ES6+ features
- Follow the existing code style (enforced by ESLint and Prettier)
- Use functional components with hooks (no class components)
- Add PropTypes for all component props
- Add JSDoc comments for functions and complex logic
- Keep functions focused and under 150 lines when possible

#### Git Commits

- Use present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Prefix with type:
  - `Add:` for new features
  - `Fix:` for bug fixes
  - `Update:` for changes to existing features
  - `Remove:` for removing code or files
  - `Docs:` for documentation changes
  - `Style:` for formatting changes
  - `Refactor:` for code refactoring
  - `Test:` for adding or updating tests

#### Code Style

- **Indentation**: 2 spaces (no tabs)
- **Quotes**: Double quotes for JSX, single quotes for JS
- **Semicolons**: Yes, always
- **Line length**: Maximum 80-100 characters
- **File naming**: PascalCase for components, camelCase for utilities
