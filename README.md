### 🪝 Git Hooks with Husky

This project uses **Husky** for Git hooks to maintain code quality automatically:

**What is Husky?**
Husky is a tool that makes Git hooks easy. It runs scripts before certain Git actions (like commit or push) to ensure code quality.

**Pre-commit Hook** (`.husky/pre-commit`):

- ✅ Automatically runs ESLint on staged files
- ✅ Automatically formats code with Prettier
- ✅ Prevents commits if there are linting errors
- ✅ Ensures consistent code style across the team

**Benefits:**

- No more "fix lint errors" commits
- Consistent formatting across all developers
- Faster CI/CD pipelines (fewer failed builds)
- Higher code quality in the repository

The hook configuration uses `lint-staged` to only check files you're actually committing.

## 📋 Data Format (CSV & Excel)

Your CSV or Excel file should follow this format:

```csv
